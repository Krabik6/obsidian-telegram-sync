### Privacy Policy for Telegram Sync

#### Last updated: 18.10.2023

Thank you for choosing to use Telegram Sync, an open-source plugin developed for the Obsidian platform. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy and personal information when using our plugin.

---

#### Introduction

Telegram Sync is designed to transfer messages and files from Telegram to your Obsidian vault. This plugin is engineered with a dual-layered architecture, utilizing two types of connections with Telegram: Bot API and Client API. Both Bot API and Client API connections are highly secure, using Telegram's native MTProto encryption protocol to ensure the utmost safety of your data during transmission. MTProto is Telegram's proprietary encryption protocol that is designed to make your messages and files secure against a wide array of cybersecurity threats. It uses end-to-end encryption and has been examined for potential vulnerabilities by security experts. When employing Telegram Sync, all data flows are conducted within the boundaries of these secure API connections, making it a reliable and secure choice for your data transfer needs. Given the plugin's design, we can assure you that your data remains confidential and secure during its journey from Telegram to your Obsidian vault.

#### Information We Collect

As an open-source plugin, Telegram Sync does **not** collect any personal or non-personal data from its users. All data transfers occur solely between your Telegram account and your Obsidian vault. We do not store, share, or have access to any of this information.

---

#### Data Transfer and Storage

All data transferred by Telegram Sync are processed locally on your computer. Your Telegram messages and files are transferred directly to your Obsidian vault without any third-party intervention.
There are no external servers that might compromise the security or confidentiality of your data. This direct approach allows for more secure and reliable communication between your Telegram account and Obsidian vault. The plugin essentially serves as an alternative Telegram client, similar to other third-party Telegram clients like Plus Messenger and Nekogram.

#### User Authentication and Session Management

If you choose to connect as a user, you'll go through Telegram's standard two-factor authentication process, and the plugin will register a new session within your Telegram account's list of devices. This ensures that your Telegram login credentials are verified, secure, and directly linked to your device or current location (IP address). All data, including session information, is stored locally on your machine, bolstering your data's safety. However, as the plugin connects to Telegram servers, it is advisable to secure your Telegram account with a strong, unique password and two-factor authentication.

#### Data Deletion

Telegram Sync offers the option to delete processed messages from Telegram once they have been transferred to your Obsidian vault. The deletion of these messages is entirely within your control and is not mandatory to use this plugin.
